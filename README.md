# Autonolas Governance & Tokens

## Bounty Program
:mega::satellite::boom: The Autonolas bounty program and its details are available [here](https://immunefi.com/bounty/autonolas/).

## Introduction
This repository contains the Autonolas `OLAS` token and the governance part of the on-chain protocol.

A graphical overview of the whole on-chain architecture is available here:

![architecture](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/docs/On-chain_architecture_v5.png)
Please note that `buOLAS` contract is not part of the diagram.

We follow the standard governance setup by OpenZeppelin. Our governance token is a voting escrow token (`veOLAS`) created by locking `OLAS`.

An overview of the design is provided [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/docs/Governance_process.pdf) and the contracts' specifications are provided [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/docs/Specs%20of%20governance%20contracts_v1.1.0.pdf).

- [OLAS](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/OLAS.sol);
- [VotingEscrow (veOLAS)](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/veOLAS.sol);
- [GovernorOLAS](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/GovernorOLAS.sol);
- [Timelock](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/Timelock.sol).

For team incentivisation we have a burnable locked `OLAS` token - `buOLAS`:
- [buOLAS](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/buOLAS.sol).

In order to deploy OLAS and veOLAS contracts via the create2() method, the following contract is utilized for vanity addresses:
- [DeploymentFactory](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/DeploymentFactory.sol).

To address several found `veOLAS` contract view functions issues, a wrapper contract `wveOLAS` is implemented:
- [veOLAS wrapper (wveOLAS)](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/wveOLAS.sol).

The changelog leading to the implementation of `wveOLAS` can be found here: [Changelog_v1.1.0](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/docs/Changelog_v1.1.0.pdf)

To complement, a list of known vulnerabilities can be found here: [Vulnerabilities list](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/docs/Vulnerabilities_list_governance.pdf)

In order to manage cross-bridge transactions via the `Timelock` contract on L2 networks, the following contracts are implemented:
- Polygon PoS: [FxGovernorTunnel](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/bridges/FxGovernorTunnel.sol);
- Gnosis: [HomeMediator](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/bridges/HomeMediator.sol);
- Optimism and Base: [OptimismMessenger](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/bridges/OptimismMessenger.sol);
- L2 networks without own native bridge: [WormholeMessenger](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/bridges/WormholeMessenger.sol);

The functionality thereby enabled is outlined in detail here: [Cross-chain governance](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/docs/governace_bridge.pdf).

Exceptionally, some changes to the Autonolas Protocol can be executed by a community-owned multisig wallet (CM), bypassing the governance process (see [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-aip/blob/aip-3/content/aips/core-enhancing-autonolas-protocol-security.md)). To align CM actions with the DAOâ€™s intent and ensure their reversibility, the following contracts are implemented:
- [GuardCM](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/multisigs/GuardCM.sol)
- [VerifyData](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/multisigs/VerifyData.sol)
- [ProcessBridgedDataArbitrum](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/multisigs/bridge_verifier/ProcessBridgedDataArbitrum.sol)
- [ProcessBridgedDataGnosis](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/multisigs/bridge_verifier/ProcessBridgedDataGnosis.sol)
- [ProcessBridgedDataOptimism](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/multisigs/bridge_verifier/ProcessBridgedDataOptimism.sol)
- [ProcessBridgedDataPolygon](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/multisigs/bridge_verifier/ProcessBridgedDataPolygon.sol)
- [ProcessBridgedDataWormhole](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/multisigs/bridge_verifier/ProcessBridgedDataWormhole.sol)
- [VerifyBridgedData](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/multisigs/bridge_verifier/VerifyBridgedData.sol)

The functionality enabled by this modular guard mechanism is introduced [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/governance/docs/guardCM_modular_approach.pdf).

The following contract was implemented to allow DAO members (via veOLAS) to vote on staking programs and trigger Olas Staking emissions, assigning weights according to their preferences"
- [VoteWeighting.sol](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/contracts/VoteWeighting.sol).

This contracts adopts a model similar to the [Curve Gauge Controller](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-gauges.html#dao-gauges-controller), maintains a list of gauges and their associated weights.  Modifications from the original Curve Gauge Controller include granting anyone the ability to add staking contracts by removing ownership control on this functionality, and eliminating additional categorization by contract type. 
For more details on VotingWeight, see [Olas staking smart contracts](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/docs/StakingSmartContracts.pdf) and [Olas staking whitepaper](https://staking.olas.network/poaa-whitepaper.pdf).

### Comparison of veOLAS and Curve Voting Escrow (veCRV) contracts via forking
Several test scripts have been written in order to compare the behavior of veOLAS and veCRV, which can be found here:
[veCompare](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/scripts/veCompare).

The original Voting Escrow ABI is located here: [veCRV ABI](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/abis/test/veCRV.json).
One can run the forking test via the `npm run fork` command as described above.

## Deployment of Core Contracts
The deployment of contracts to the test- and main-net is split into step-by-step series of scripts for more control and checkpoint convenience.
The description of deployment procedure can be found here: [deployment](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/scripts/deployment).

The finalized contract ABIs for deployment and their number of optimization passes are located here:
[ABIs](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/abis).

## Bridges

### Cross-chain governance
Depending on the network, the cross-chain functionalities enabled are outlined in detail here:
[Cross-chain governance](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/docs/governace_bridge.pdf).

In order to correctly pack the data and supply it to the Timelock such that it is correctly processed across the bridge,
use the following script: [cross-bridge data packing](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/scripts/deployment/bridges/pack_data.js).

#### Polygon governance bridge 
Autonolas will use the [FxPortal](https://github.com/fx-portal/contracts) developed and designed by the Polygon team to support cross-chain bridging from Ethereum to Polygon.

For running a test between `goerli` and `mumbai`, run the test script with your own credentials:
[`goerli-mumbai` hello world bridge test](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/scripts/deployment/bridges/polygon/test/fx_goerli_mumbai_hello_world.js)
and [`goerli-mumbai` governor bridge test](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/scripts/deployment/bridges/polygon/test/fx_goerli_mumbai_governor.js).
Note that the script must be run without Hardhat environment, i.e.: `node test_script.js`.

#### Gnosis governance bridge
Autonolas will use the [Arbitrary Message Bridge](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/tokenbridge/amb-bridge) developed
and designed by the Gnosis team to support cross-chain bridging from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain.

For running a test between `goerli` and `chiado`, run the test script with your own credentials:
[`goerli-chiado` hello world bridge test](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/scripts/deployment/bridges/gnosis/test/mediator_goerli_chiado_hello_world.js)
and [`goerli-chiado` governor bridge test](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/scripts/deployment/bridges/polygon/test/mediator_goerli_chiado_governor.js).
Note that the script must be run without Hardhat environment, i.e.: `node test_script.js`.

#### Arbitrum governance bridge
Autonolas will use the [Address Aliasing](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing) mechanism
in order to directly send messages between L1 and L2 via the Inbox.

#### Optimism and Base governance bridge
Autonolas will use the [L1 Cross Domain Messenger](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/dapp-developers/bridging/messaging)
developed and designed by the Optimism team to support cross-chain bridging from Ethereum to Optimism / Base Chains.

For running a test between L1 `sepolia` and L2 `sepolia`, run the test script with your own credentials:
[`sepolia-optimistic-sepolia` governor bridge test](scripts/deployment/bridges/optimistic/test/messenger_sepolia_optimistic_sepolia_governor.js)
and [`sepolia-base-sepolia` governor bridge test](scripts/deployment/bridges/optimistic/test/messenger_sepolia_base_sepolia_governor.js).
Note that the script must be run without Hardhat environment, i.e.: `node test_script.js`.

#### Wormhole governance bridge
Note that if a native bridge is not available on a specific network, the [Wormhole](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/)
message passing protocol is utilized in order to manage the data transfer between L1 and L2-s. For example, this is
the case for the Celo network.

For running a test between L1 `sepolia` and L2 `celo alfajores`, run the test script with your own credentials:
[`sepolia-celo-alfajores` governor bridge test](scripts/deployment/bridges/wormhole/test/messenger_sepolia_celo_alfajores_governor.js).
Note that the script must be run without Hardhat environment, i.e.: `node test_script.js`.

### Deployment of bridge-related contracts
The description of bridge-related deployment procedure is very similar to the original deployment process and can be found here:
- [bridges-polygon](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/scripts/deployment/bridges/polygon);
- [bridges-gnosis](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/scripts/deployment/bridges/gnosis);
- [bridges-optimism-base](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/scripts/deployment/bridges/optimistic);
- [bridges-wormhole](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/scripts/deployment/bridges/wormhole).

### ERC20 token bridging
Autonolas will use native bridges for ERC20 token transfers, where possible. If a native bridge is not available or
does not correspond to all the required specifications, the [Wormhole Portal](https://portalbridge.com/advanced-tools/#/transfer)
is utilized in order to manage the ERC20 token transfers between L1 and L2-s.

For more information about OLAS bridging see [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/docs/olas_bridging.md)  

#### Special case (currently not utilized): ERC20 token bridging between Polygon and Ethereum
The contract design facilitating token bridging between the Polygon and Ethereum networks, along with the underlying
motivations driving the creation of these contracts, is outlined here:
[Bridging token](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-governance/blob/main/docs/Bonding_mechanism_with_Polygon_LP_token.pdf).

The description of ERC20 token bridging deployment between Polygon and Ethereum can be found here:
