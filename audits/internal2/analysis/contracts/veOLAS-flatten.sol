/**
Votes have a weight depending on time, so that users are committed to the future of (whatever they are voting for).
Vote weight decays linearly over time. Lock time cannot be more than `MAXTIME` (4 years).
Voting escrow has time-weighted votes derived from the amount of tokens locked. The maximum voting power can be
achieved with the longest lock possible. This way the users are incentivized to lock tokens for more time.

We cannot really do block numbers per se because slope is per time, not per block, and per block could be fairly bad
because Ethereum changes its block times. What we can do is to extrapolate ***At functions.

/// @title Voting Escrow OLAS - the workflow is ported from Curve Finance Vyper implementation
/// @author Aleksandr Kuperman - <aleksandr.kuperman@valory.xyz>
/// Code ported from: https://github.com/curvefi/curve-dao-contracts/blob/master/contracts/VotingEscrow.vy
/// and: https://github.com/solidlyexchange/solidly/blob/master/contracts/ve.sol

/* This VotingEscrow is based on the OLAS token that has the following specifications:
*  - For the first 10 years there will be the cap of 1 billion (1e27) tokens;
*  - After 10 years, the inflation rate is 2% per year.
* The maximum number of tokens for each year then can be calculated from the formula: 2^n = 1e27 * (1.02)^x,
* where n is the specified number of bits that is sufficient to store and not overflow the total supply,
* and x is the number of years. We limit n by 128, thus it would take 1340+ years to reach that total supply.
* The amount for each locker is eventually cannot overcome this number as well, and thus uint128 is sufficient.
*
* We then limit the time in seconds to last until the value of 2^64 - 1, or for the next 583+ billion years.
* The number of blocks is essentially cannot be bigger than the number of seconds, and thus it is safe to assume
* that uint64 for the number of blocks is also sufficient.
*
* We also limit the individual deposit amount to be no bigger than 2^96 - 1, or the value of total supply in 220+ years.
* This limitation is dictated by the fact that there will be at least several accounts with locked tokens, and the
* sum of all of them cannot be bigger than the total supply. Checking the limit of deposited / increased amount
* allows us to perform the unchecked operation on adding the amounts.
*
* The rest of calculations throughout the contract do not go beyond specified limitations. The contract was checked
* by echidna and the results can be found in the audit section of the repository.
*
* These specified limits allowed us to have storage-added structs to be bound by 2*256 and 1*256 bit sizes
* respectively, thus limiting the gas amount compared to using bigger variable sizes.
*
* Note that after 220 years it is no longer possible to deposit / increase the locked amount to be bigger than 2^96 - 1.
* It is going to be not safe to use this contract for governance after 1340 years.
